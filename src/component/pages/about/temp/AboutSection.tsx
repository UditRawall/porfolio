            <p>Good evening, I'm Udit! Originally from India, I'm now based in the vibrant place that is Delhi.</p>
            <p>My curiosity for computers began at age 10, which naturally led me to pursue a career in tech. I've been working as a software engineer, specializing in full-stack development and design, for more than 1 years now!</p>
            <p>Good evening, I'm Brian Ruiz! Originally from Honduras, I'm now based in the vibrant place that is New York City.</p>
            <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy staying active—whether it’s hitting the gym, cruising on my e-bike, or unwinding with a good cup of coffee.</p>
